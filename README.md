# Learning to learn with TensorFlow playground

## Introduction to tensor-flow playground
[The tensor-flow playground](https://playground.tensorflow.org/) is a wonderful tool to experiment with simple neural nets.

Given a small number of problems in 2-dimensions (x1, x2), you're asked to design a good classifier / regressor model
that will correctly predict the (output) value of every point in input space by tinkering with various model parameters.

Making the right model-design decisions can result in dramatic differences in the model quality.

The challenge is to create the best model possible for each of the problems presented.


## How can we tell we have a good/great model?


### Final test and test error
### Convergence speed
### Smoothness of the learning curve
### Train vs test gap
### Clean boundaries between classes
### Overfitting vs underfitting
### Other generalization considerations 

## Importance of the input features

### The concentric spiral problem 
#### coordinate projections can make a big difference
